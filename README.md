fair-ubuntu-centre
==================

This project is an attempt to structure and open source the efforts of FAIR in Malawi. The motivation is to distribute
big data open source and open access projects to remote areas with no internet connectivity, rather than wasting efforts
on expensive and/or badly-functioning mobile networks.

The project provides the scripts necessary to configure a normal desktop installation of Ubuntu 12.04 to become a
network server, TFTP install server, and HTTP intranet server for a variety of offline resources (hereunder the full Ubuntu repositories!).

In order to use the scripts, a (possibly external) hard drive must be created with a number of optional resources.

Documentation
-------------

As of today, there is still a pending documentation project and a guide for system maintainers in the works.

Choice of Linux OS
------------------

The project will continue to be based on Ubuntu 12.04 until the release of 14.04 has been out for at least 6 months.
Current experiences hint that school computers are better off with less machine intensive Linux desktop, hence Ubuntu 10.04
is actually providing a better user experience regarding the responsiveness of older hardware (256 MB, <2 GHz CPU).
