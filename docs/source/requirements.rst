============

* Additional hard drive containing data, *Data Drive*, see Obtaining Data (TODO: Add drive layout specs)
   * Ubuntu 32 bit repositories: 120+ GByte (fixed requirement)

   * Various Ebooks and Documentary movies at unspecified locations
     as referenced by Intranet pages.
* Installscripts copied to a USB flash
* Server hardware: SATA host recommended.
* Server processor requirements: None really, storage is the main feature
* Server memory: 1+ GB, more memory is recommended as it allows faster response times from HTTP servers,
