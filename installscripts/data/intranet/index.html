<div class="contents why_democracy">
  <h1>Documentaries</h1>
  <p>
    Why Democracy and Why Poverty are documentary projects using film to start a global conversation about democracy and poverty. The movies will show you important subjects from around the world. Often the matters are so complex that it is difficult to say who/what is right and wrong.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Before watching a movie, you should find a pair of headphones and plug into the computer. Make sure that the sound is on. If you do not have time enough at the computer to watch the movie, maybe you can ask your teacher to screen it for you and your class mates.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In order to play a movie, click the picture of the movie. A program for playing movies will then start. The movies are just like DVDs, so first you will have to navigate a DVD menu and maybe add subtitles in English. Good luck!

      Freedom of expression is a democratic principle: does this mean ‘limitless freedom’, and at what cost to other democratic rights?  Are some democratic values more important than others? Cartoons in a Danish provincial paper brought these questions to the forefront of world politics<br />

      What does an education get you?

In ancient times in China, education was the only way out of poverty – in recent times it has been the best way. China’s economic boom and talk of the merits of hard work have created an expectation that to study is to escape poverty. But these days China’s education system only leads to jobs for a few, educating a new generation to unemployment and despair.  <br />

      <strong>About this film:</strong><br />
      From Live Aid to Make Poverty History, celebrities have become activists against poverty. Bob Geldof and Bono have been the most prominent voices advocating on behalf of the poor. Geldof, Bono and Bill Gates speak candidly about how to lobby effectively and how to play to politicians’ weaknesses for glitz and popularity.<br />

      <strong>About this film:</strong><br />
      75% of Mali's population are farmers, but rich, land-hungry nations like China and Saudi Arabia are leasing Mali's land in order to turn large areas into agribusiness farms. Many Malian peasants do not welcome these efforts, seeing them as yet another manifestation of imperialism. As Mali experiences a military coup, the developers are scared off - but can Mali's farmers combat food shortages and escape poverty on their own terms?

      740 Park Ave, New York City, is home to some of the wealthiest Americans. Across the Harlem River, 10 minutes to the north, is the other Park Avenue in South Bronx, where more than half the population needs food stamps and children are 20 times more likely to be killed. In the last 30 years, inequality has rocketed in the US -- the American Dream only applies to those with money to lobby politicians for friendly bills on Capitol Hill.

      <strong>About this film:</strong><br />
      The poor may always have been with us, but attitudes towards them have changed. Beginning in the Neolithic Age, Ben Lewis's film takes us through the changing world of poverty. You go to sleep, you dream, you become poor through the ages. And when you awake, what can you say about poverty now? There are still very poor people, to be sure, but the new poverty has more to do with inequality...

      Rafea is the second wife of a Bedouin husband. She is selected to attend the Barefoot College in India that takes uneducated middle-aged women from poor communities and trains them to become solar engineers. The college's 6-month programme brings together women from all over the world. Learning about electrical components and soldering without being able to read, write or understand English is the easy part. Witness Rafea's heroic efforts to pull herself and her family out of poverty.

      <strong>About this film:</strong><br />
      Rüschlikon is a village in Switzerland with a very low tax rate and very wealthy residents. But it receives more tax revenue than it can use. This is largely thanks to one resident - Ivan Glasenberg, CEO of Glencore, whose copper mines in Zambia are not generating a large bounty tax revenue for the Zambians. Zambia has the 3rd largest copper reserves in the world, but 60% of the population live on less than $1 a day and 80% are unemployed. Based on original research into public documents, the film describes the tax system employed by multinational companies in Africa.

      In the Jaintia Hills of northeast India, a young boy descends everyday into the 'rathole' coalmines. He works in these hard and dangerous conditions, so he can support his family. But in the dark he dreams of digging to the 'other end of the world'. He cherishes the hope of a better life. Even the darkest tunnel is no limit to the boy's imagination and courage. But does the boy's dreams carry a burden too immense to overcome? Are the inequities of the world too vast for the boy's hope to become reality?

      Around 500,000 people rely on Lake Turkana for fishing and for water for their crops and cattle. But the lake is drying up and there communities are fighting to survive. "They kill each other because of grass and water," says one man. Just like the lake, a whole way of life is disappearing. Who is to blame, the people upstream for damming the Omo River or the developed world for causing climate change?

      On one side of the world American star investor Jim Rogers arrives at his elegant offices and explains how large investments and movements of money affect prices. On the other side of the world market vendors in Kenya feel the effects. Prices on global exchanges for maize and wheat have tripled in the last 5 years. Maize has been the best-performing investment since the financial crisis began. Global returns rose in the last 5 years by: 55% for oil; 144% for gold; 146% for maize. You might also want to watch Land Rush about the race for land in Africa. How can so much money be made from food speculation and a billion people still go hungry in the world?

      Every winter Pushkar in India holds a seven-day religious festival and the world's biggest camel fair. With around 25,000 camels in town, you can expect a lot of camel droppings. And these droppings provide an opportunity -- a chance for poor families to save money on firewood and other fuels by collecting the dung, drying it out and using it to cook their food. It's not the easiest job for the women who collect these droppings, they have to deal with the unpredictable nature of the camels and run the gauntlet of tourists photographing them as they go about their work.

      Sea Gypsies On the Idyllic coral island in eastern Malaysia, increasingly tight fishing restrictions are making it difficult for the locals to survive. Eventually, they must make a choice for their survival.Life was once simple for the people on the island, but now the fishing restrictions make it hard to find food. Determined Indanina fantasises about life beyond this. She must make a choice - stay and risk starving, or leave for the city. And in reality, there is only one option. When they go, however, life in the city is not as she expected. The film explores the relationship between money and choice - Indanina and her family have little wealth, and are helpless against those who do. With more and more tourists seeking out remote places to visit, is there a danger they're ruining the very idylls they are searching for?

Every day in Maracaibo Lake 832 000 barrels of oil are extracted. Each barrel brings in 100 US dollars. Luis' family lives on less than 150 dollars a month.We see life in the floating village through a child's eyes - the fun of building a boat to take part in a race - but what are the challenges of living there and bringing up a family?

      130 million babies are born each year, and not one of them decides where they'll be born or how they'll live. In Cambodia, you're likely to be born to a family living on less than $1/day. In Sierra Leone chances of surviving the first year are half those of the worldwide average. Brian Hill takes a worldwide trip to meet the newest generation.

      <strong>About this film:</strong><br />
    An estimated 800,000 square kilometres of farmland in the developing world have been sold to foreign entities. This short film shows business Mali-style. Want to buy some land? No problem! Village in the way? No problem with that either, we'lll just move it... This short film is bonus material from the long film Land Rush, which looks at this of land rights in greater detail.

      <strong>About this film:</strong><br />
    Along the way, Wilbur asks his fellow countrymen what they think poverty is: what do people need to be without for them to be deemed impoverished? And he speaks to some of India's poor so we can see what they have and what they can show us. Episode 1 of "Wilbur Goes Poor" focuses on what poverty is.

      <strong>About this film:</strong><br />
    Wilbur Sargunaraj, India's first You tube star, takes us on an enlightening and often irreverent journey into poverty and the lives of India's poor.Along the way, in Episode 2, Wilbur asks what causes poverty? He shows how the cast system is "not very first class". There is inequality, but to make it a better place you have to start right now. "In life you should be content as these two goats. See how content they are."
